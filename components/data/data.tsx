    bio: `Brandon joined Community Connections for Independent Living (CCFIL) in 2015 after being involved in a serious car accident and sustaining a traumatic brain injury. When asked about his initial expectations of the program, Brandon stated, “I thought it was going to be like a prison; being held by the hand, told what to do, what not to do, or even how to do it.” Brandon’s perspective has since evolved. “It wasn’t anything like I thought it would be”, he states. 
    Brandon credits CCFIL’s Occupational Therapists and rehabilitation specialists for changing his outlook and alleviating his apprehension. “The therapists will tailor your program according to what you need and what you don’t need. I built a relationship with each and every one of them,” Brandon explains, “It’s different because they don’t look at you as if you have a brain injury, or that something is wrong with you. They look at you as a human being and they treat you like a human being.” 
    Treating others with dignity and respect is one of many fundamental elements of CCFIL and one that it values wholeheartedly. “There are all ages within the program. I am friends with a lot of the different residents here. We all support each other,” states Brandon. 
    Community Connections allows each resident to take ownership of their individual goals and objectives as well as the process in which to accomplish them. Brandon’s hopes from the beginning was to become employed. “The therapists helped me to get on the route that I wanted to go, like working in the Henry Ford Hospital, as well as another job at a Pancake Factory.” While CCFIL’s Supported Employment program helped Brandon obtain these two positions, his hard work and ambition have allowed him to achieve this goal. 
    Brandon is also determined to obtain his high school diploma. He cheerfully states, “The program is helping me out, got me into [a program] that teaches and allows you to get your high school diploma.” Since coming to CCFIL, Brandon has made significant academic progress and is diligently working towards credits necessary for his degree. 
    “Come here with an open mind and a clean slate, and you’ll find out that it’s nothing like you thought it was going to be”, advises Brandon. 
    Brandon is mindful and appreciative of his accomplishments since entering our program, and his enthusiasm continues to guide him towards his goals. “[Before the accident] at home, I was depressed and needing my own space” he says. “[Now]I am completely different and for the better.”`,

    bio: `“When I first met David, his conversations and eye contact were brief. It took quite a few interactions for David to feel comfortable with not only myself, but other rehabilitation assistants as well,” states Assistant Program Director, Michele Gorski. At first, Michele along with other CCFIL staff members, found it challenging to get David to engage in the program or remain motivated to obtain his goals. 
    David was only 18 years old when he came to CCFIL. Looking back on the six years he was in their program, David gives the CCFIL staff credit for helping him get to where he is today. “They gave me a lot of opportunities to become an adult. Ron and Mike are great people.” 
    Early on, David was provided with an opportunity to work at a local pet supply store through CCFIL’s Supported Employment program. In the beginning, David would work about 4 hours at a time needing frequent redirection and motivation to complete his assigned tasks. However, it wasn’t long before the store managers noticed tremendous improvement in David’s confidence and work-group interactions. In the end, David was asked to join the team as a full-time employee, independent of CCFIL’s Supported Employment program. Time, trust, and mutual respect was what ultimately helped David connect and succeed at CCFIL. 
    Over the course of his rehabilitation, David turned his love for landscape design into competitive employment. He also learned to successfully connect with others by inviting them to partake in his love for cooking. By the end of his stay at CCFIL, David excelled at home organizational, pro-social, and employment skills, which helped pave the way to his success outside of the program. Now almost 30, David has become a full-time employee as a Landscape Designer at Deborah Silver & Company. “We were sad to see him discharged”, says Michele, “but we were confident that he would accomplish great things on his own.”`,

    bio: `Shortly after her 17th birthday, Heather was involved in a serious car accident that left her in a prolonged coma. “The doctors originally told my parents I was going to be in a coma until my 30s,” Heather explains. Although Heather made an astounding recovery, it wasn’t without challenges. She returned to her hometown to “finish high school, get married and have one daughter, Glory Anne Grace”, but had a difficult time adjusting to daily life. 
    “When I lived in Battle Creek I was struggling,” says Heather. “I went to the YMCA for water therapy and church. That was it. Everything changed when I came to Community Connections for Independent Living. It’s a whole lot better than when I lived in Battle Creek”. 
    Heather was introduced to Community Connections by her case manager. Heather was familiar with other programs supportive of traumatic brain injury, but she was enlightened to learn that Community Connections willingly accepted the children of their residents. “Other programs wouldn’t allow for her to stay with me and being separated wasn’t an option,” explains Heather. 
    As a resident of Community Connections, Heather participates in the many social and volunteer opportunities that are available, including Women’s Group, Community Connections newsletter, and CC Cares. “It really feels like a family,” says Heather, “I love that there are people here to help me. In Battle Creek I had nothing; I had the cab service and nothing else. Life is so much more enjoyable here.” 
    Heather embraces her interests and enjoys water therapy, painting and sculpting lessons at Paint A Miracle, and practicing and sharing her faith with others. “I love listening to Christian music,” she says. Heather’s active schedule also includes occupational therapy, doctor’s appointments, and daily housework. “I like to stay busy,” says Heather, “It makes me feel really good that I have support here and I have friends here.” 
    Heather’s enthusiasm for life continues to motivate her to achieve her goals. “I want to continue to become a stronger me and to continue to keep up with my all my programs. Ultimately, I want to be the best me I can be.”`,
